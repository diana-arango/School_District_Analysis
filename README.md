# School_District_Analysis


## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate how the evidence of academic dishonesty in math and reading scores at Thomas High School may affect the summary results, obtained during Module's 4 analysis. Therefore, loc method and logical and comparison operators will be applied to retrieve information from all the rows in certain DataFrames and then re calculate new values. It is also expected to replace some values with Nan in Thomas High School data and re-run the code performed for Pycity Board to adjust the summaries 

## Results

### 	District Summary:
####	No changes on the district summary despite of disregarding 9th graders at Thomas High School

###	Math and reading scores by grade:
Scores remained equal for grades 10th to 12th in both analysis  however math and reading scores deferred during the challenge since values from grade 9th were replaced with nan
